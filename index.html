        <h2>What is Lodash?</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript in its original form can (at times) be a bit tough for a
          person to know what to code in order to accomplish the goal that
          person has in mind. It can also be tedious at times to write out all
          of your commonly used functions, loops, and such over and over again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter, Lodash. Lodash is what's referred to as a "reference library"
          for the JavaScript programming language. It's a collection of
          pre-written code that allows coders to work faster, smarter, and with
          consistency. Here are some this particular library's capabilities:

        <h3>Our Data</h3>
        <p>
          So, before we get too ahead of ourselves we're going to need some data
          to manipulate. Real world examples are always ideal, so...Oh! I know!
          Let's solve a mystery!

        <h3>The Case of the Sneaky Sandwich Smuggler</h3>
        <h6>*working title</h6>
        <p>
          Someone has been taking people's sandwiches from the office
          refrigerator! And that just won't do. No sir.<br /><br />
          We'll need to put a team of people from the office together to capture
          that crafty cold cut cat burglar (the detectives stopped returning our
          calls). First, we'll need to get an array of everyone that was in the
          office!
        </p>
        <button id="office-button" onclick="showWorkerNameArray()">
          Show our suspects!
        </button>
        <section id="office-home"></section>
      </section>
      <section id="team-section" class="content">
        <h3>_.sampleSize</h3>
        <p>
          Now we know who all was in the office! Excellent. Now we need a team.
          But who to choose? Ah, there's no time! A sandwich may get stolen
          while we debate! Let's pick five workers at random using Lodash's
          _.sampleSize:
        </p>
        <button id="team-button" onclick="getMysteryTeam()">
          Choose our team!

      </section>
      <section id="chunk-section" class="content">
        <h3>_.chunk</h3>
        <p>
          Okay team, we've got a lot of people to interview and not a lot of
          time (lunch is on the line!) Hmm, we've got fifty people to interview,
          so let's divide everyone up into groups of ten using the Lodash
          method, _.chunk (separated by little squares for ease of reading):
        </p>
        <button id="chunk-button" onclick="divideAndConquer()">
          Split the Suspects!

      </section>
      <section id="reverse-section" class="content">
        <h3>_.reverse</h3>
        <p>
          They're still not cracking! Hmm, maybe they're talking to each other,
          getting their stories straight. Let's flip the group around with
          _.reverse, see if that shakes them up!
        </p>
        <button id="reverse-button" onclick="reverseWorkers()">Reverse!</button>
        <section id="reverse-home"></section>
      </section>
      <section id="shuffle-section" class="content">
        <h3>_.shuffle</h3>
        <p>
          Well that didn't work. Oh! Of course! We just reversed the order. Any
          conspirators would still be able to talk to each other! Let's really
          get them separated using _.shuffle!
        </p>
        <button id="shuffle-button" onclick="shuffleWorkers()">Shuffle!</button>
        <section id="shuffle-home"></section>

      <section id="without-section" class="content">
        <h3>_.without</h3>
        <p>
          New information has come about! We found a list of sandwich theft
          crimes from all around the city and a few names kept cropping up!
          Maybe they have more information than they were letting on, eh? The
          names in question were "John", "Cody", Allison, "Eric", "Jenny",
          "Ann", "Tina", "Jim", "Ryan" and "James". So, if any of those names
          are on our suspect list, we can remove them the group for extra
          interrogation. Let's let the group know that we will be splitting them
          up, eh?

          Remove suspects!

        <h3>Mystery Solved!</h3>
        <p>
          A confession! Threatening to separate them all worked, and we now know
          who took the sandwiches! (And who's now buying us all lunch.) See the
          answer below!
